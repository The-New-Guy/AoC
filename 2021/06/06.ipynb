    "The sea floor is getting steeper. Maybe the sleigh keys got carried this way?\n",
    "\n",
    "A massive school of glowing [lanternfish](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lanternfish) swims past. They must spawn quickly to reach such large numbers - maybe **exponentially** quickly? You should model their growth rate to be sure.\n",
    "\n",
    "Although you know nothing about this specific species of lanternfish, you make some guesses about their attributes. Surely, each lanternfish creates a new lanternfish once every `7` days.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, this process isn't necessarily synchronized between every lanternfish - one lanternfish might have 2 days left until it creates another lanternfish, while another might have 4. So, you can model each fish as a single number that represents **the number of days until it creates a new lanternfish**.\n",
    "\n",
    "Furthermore, you reason, a **new** lanternfish would surely need slightly longer before it's capable of producing more lanternfish: two more days for its first cycle.\n",
    "\n",
    "So, suppose you have a lanternfish with an internal timer value of `3`:\n",
    "\n",
    "- After one day, its internal timer would become `2`.\n",
    "- After another day, its internal timer would become `1`.\n",
    "- After another day, its internal timer would become `0`.\n",
    "- After another day, its internal timer would reset to `6`, and it would create a **new** lanternfish with an internal timer of `8`.\n",
    "- After another day, the first lanternfish would have an internal timer of `5`, and the second lanternfish would have an internal timer of `7`.\n",
    "\n",
    "A lanternfish that creates a new fish resets its timer to `6`, **not** `7` (because `0` is included as a valid timer value). The new lanternfish starts with an internal timer of `8` and does not start counting down until the next day.\n",
    "\n",
    "Realizing what you're trying to do, the submarine automatically produces a list of the ages of several hundred nearby lanternfish (your puzzle input). For example, suppose you were given the following list:\n",
    "\n",
    "`3,4,3,1,2`\n",
    "\n",
    "This list means that the first fish has an internal timer of `3`, the second fish has an internal timer of `4`, and so on until the fifth fish, which has an internal timer of `2`. Simulating these fish over several days would proceed as follows:\n",

    "In the first part of the solution I used Numpy library which typically provides some convienient and efficient array operations. However, one of the methods it uses to make things efficient is always allocating the entire array in continguous memory. This means appending new elements to a Numpy array actually requires the entire array to be copied in memory to a new location big enough to accept this additional element. Of the three operations done on the Numpy array, two of them require this copying of the array process.\n",
    "\n",
    "Despite the above mentioned inefficiencies, this solution still worked fairly well for the first part. The example input tests each completed in milliseconds or less, and the problem input took ~44 seconds to complete. However, when moving on to the second part of the problem, where 256 days needed to be simulated, it never completed. I let it run on the example input over night; over seven hours before cancelling it.\n",

    "At first I thought about parallelizing the task by spining up a new process each the number of total fish hit a certain size. Split list of fish and run them separately in different processes. However, even if I managed to do this without spinning up too many processes, there would still be an issue with memory. Each of the methods above involve using a list whose elements are each fish's timer. If each fish's timer is an `int32`, then that means each fish requires 4-bytes of memory to store its timer. The example input alone will reach `~26` billion fish after `256` cycles, which will require `~100GB` of memory. My final solution for my problem input returned `~1.7` trillion fish after `256` cycles, which would have required `~6TB` of memory.\n",
    "\n",
    "Obviously I needed a solution that doesn't actually keep track of each individual fish timer. Instead, I'll simply keep track of how many fish are in each of the 9 possible stages of a fish's reproduction cycle, two of which are juvinile stages. So in total I only need to keep track of 9 numbers at any given time. The first index of the list (i.e `0` index), would contain a count of all fish about to reproduce, second element (i.e. index `1`) would have the count of each fish with one day left, and so on. The last two stages, `8` (index `7`) and `9` (index `8`), are the juvinile stages.\n",
    "\n",
    "After each day cycle, each of the counts in each of the 9 stages shift left in the array. Index `1` moves to index `0`, and index `0` moves to the back of the list at index `8` (stage `9`). Each of the fish that wrapped around to the end just reproduced. That number in the last index of the array will represent the new born fish. We then add that same number to the fish that just moved from stage `8` (index `7`) to stage `7` (index `6`). This stage `7` (index `6`) now has all the fish that just reproduced and all the fish that just became adults. The day's cycle is done and repeats on the next cycle. After all requested days have passed, we simply add up the counts for all stages.\n",
    "\n",
    "This method was of course way faster, only ever working with an array of size `9`. I did run into an issue where `int32` was not a big enough data type to store the counts once we moved to the problem input. I had to specify the `int64` data type to get around this. While this worked, it means that there is still an upper bound to how many cycles can be simulated as eventually the counts would get even bigger than an `int64`. It might make sense to not use Numpy in this example and instead just use normal python lists and `int`'s, as python `int`'s are only bound by the amount of memory you have.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note, it is also possible there is a purely mathematical way to solve this problem that would avoid the need to do any counting at all. Perhaps some kind of exponential formula or factorial."
