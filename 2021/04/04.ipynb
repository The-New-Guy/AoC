    "You're already almost 1.5km (almost a mile) below the surface of the ocean, already so deep that you can't see any sunlight. What you **can** see, however, is a giant squid that has attached itself to the outside of your submarine.\n",

    "Maybe it wants to play [bingo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bingo_(American_version))?\n",
    "\n",
    "Bingo is played on a set of boards each consisting of a 5x5 grid of numbers. Numbers are chosen at random, and the chosen number is marked on all boards on which it appears. (Numbers may not appear on all boards.) If all numbers in any row or any column of a board are marked, that board **wins**. (Diagonals don't count.)\n",
    "\n",
    "The submarine has a **bingo subsystem** to help passengers (currently, you and the giant squid) pass the time. It automatically generates a random order in which to draw numbers and a random set of boards (your puzzle input). For example:\n",
